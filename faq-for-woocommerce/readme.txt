## 🤖 SCHEMA SUPPORT ##

Increasing search engine visibility is one of the best ways to grow your business. The better ranking you have, the more traffic you will get from the search engines. If you want to rank your product page, then you must use the FAQ schema.

## 🔀 SORTING FAQS ##

The XPlainer WooCommerce FAQ plugin works in a more advanced way than the other FAQ accordion plugins. This FAQ sorting feature might be a great example to support this statement.

XPlainer allows the users to sort the FAQs under different parameters like ‘**order**’ and ‘**order_by**’. You can also implement this sorting feature by using shortcodes. Check the following feature to learn about using the shortcode feature.

## 🚀 SHORTCODE SUPPORT ##

A smart representation of WooCommerce product FAQs impacts sales directly. That’s why you must display the product FAQs wherever needed. That’s why this WordPress FAQ plugin comes with the shortcode feature.


ℹ️ You can display **all FAQs** for a random product having FAQs with the default template:

`
[ffw_template]
`

ℹ️ To **display all FAQs for a specific product**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template id=20]
`

💡 Here, 20 is the product id. Replace it with your desired product id.

ℹ️ To **display FAQs for specific FAQ categories**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template cat_ids="32, 33"]
`

💡 If the cat_ids exist, then the product id will be ignored. Here 32 & 33 are FAQ categories id. Please use the comma separator while inputting the data.

If you want to sort the product FAQs using shortcodes, you can do it by using ‘order’ and ‘order_by’ parameters.

The supported values for ‘order’ (Default Value: ‘ASC’)
– ‘DESC’, ‘ASC’

The supported values for ‘order_by’ (Default Value: ‘ID’)
– ‘ID’, ‘date’, ‘title’, ‘name’, ‘date’, ‘modified’, ‘comment_count’, ‘author’.

ℹ️ Use the shortcode below to display FAQs for a current product ID (for the single product page):

`
[ffw_template dynamic_post=true]
`

💡 This shortcode is appropriate for single product pages.

ℹ️ Use the following shortcode to display all FAQs for a specific product with a specific template by this easy accordion FAQ plugin.

`
[ffw_template template=1 id=20]
`

💡 Use the following template ids to show FAQs

* For Classic Template – 1
* For Whitish Template – 2
* For Trip Template – 3
* For Pop Template – 4
* For Basic Template – 5
* For Glow Template (Pro) – 6
* For Smart Template (Pro) – 7
* For Wow Template (Pro) – 8
* For Zoom Template (Pro) – 9

## 🔎 CUSTOM STYLE SUPPORT ##

To design the product FAQs even better, the XPlainer WooCommerce FAQ plugin comes with custom styling support. By implementing this feature, you can control lots of parameters. Here is the list of those -

* FAQ wrapper width
* Question text color
* Question background color
* Question background Secondary color (applicable for pop layout)
* Question border color
* Question font size
* Answer text color
* Answer background color
* Answer border color &
* Custom CSS

💡 The **custom CSS** is the most prioritized CSS. Adding custom CSS will override the default styling.
