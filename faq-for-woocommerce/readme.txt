Happy WooCommerce FAQs allows the users to sort the FAQs under different parameters like ‘**order**’ and ‘**order_by**’. You can also implement this sorting feature by using shortcodes. Check the following feature to learn about using the shortcode feature.

## 🚀 SHORTCODE SUPPORT ##

A smart representation of WooCommerce product FAQs impacts sales directly. That’s why you must display the product FAQs wherever needed. That’s why this WordPress FAQ plugin comes with the shortcode feature.

[Read More](https://happydevs.net/docs/faq-for-woocommerce/shortcodes/)


ℹ️ You can display **all FAQs** for a random product having FAQs with the default template:

`
[ffw_template]
`

ℹ️ To **display all FAQs for a specific product**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template id=20]
`

💡 Here, 20 is the product id. Replace it with your desired product id.

ℹ️ To **display FAQs for specific FAQ categories**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template cat_ids="32, 33"]
`

💡 If the cat_ids exist, then the product id will be ignored. Here 32 & 33 are FAQ categories id. Please use the comma separator while inputting the data.

If you want to sort the product FAQs using shortcodes, you can do it by using ‘order’ and ‘order_by’ parameters.

The supported values for ‘order’ (Default Value: ‘ASC’)
– ‘DESC’, ‘ASC’

The supported values for ‘order_by’ (Default Value: ‘ID’)
– ‘ID’, ‘date’, ‘title’, ‘name’, ‘date’, ‘modified’, ‘comment_count’, ‘author’.

ℹ️ Use the shortcode below to display FAQs for a current product ID (for the single product page):

`
[ffw_template dynamic_post=true]
`

💡 This shortcode is appropriate for single product pages.

ℹ️ Use the following shortcode to display all FAQs for a specific product with a specific template by this easy accordion FAQ plugin.

`
[ffw_template template=1 id=20]
`

💡 Use the following template ids to show FAQs

* For Classic Template – 1
* For Whitish Template – 2
* For Trip Template – 3
* For Pop Template – 4
* For Basic Template – 5
* For Glow Template (Pro) – 6
* For Smart Template (Pro) – 7
